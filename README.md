# Sentiment Based Product Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **Sentiment-Based Product Recommendation System** that enhances traditional recommendation models by incorporating **sentiment analysis** from user reviews. Instead of relying solely on ratings or purchase history, this system leverages both **numerical ratings** and **textual sentiment scores** to provide more accurate and personalized product recommendations.

The project was developed as part of a **Data Science study at IIT Roorkee**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Improve recommendation accuracy using **sentiment insights** from customer reviews.  
- Combine **explicit feedback (ratings)** with **implicit feedback (review sentiments)**.  
- Build an end-to-end recommendation pipeline from **data preprocessing** to **deployment**.
